## Requirements
This work was implemented with the following frameworks:
* Spyder 3.2.x (recommended)
* Python 3.6.3
* Keras 2.0.6
* Tensorflow-gpu 1.1.0

## Usage
Easy to train! Just a single click, go! <br />
1. Clone this repo: ``git clone https://github.com/lim-anggun/FgSegNet.git``

2. Modify the following file:
    * ``<Your PYTHON 3.6>\site-packages\skimage\transform\pyramids.py`` <br/>
          in ```pyramid_reduce``` function, replace the following two lines<br/>
          ```out_rows = math.ceil(rows / float(downscale))``` <br/>
          ```out_cols = math.ceil(cols / float(downscale))``` <br/>
          with <br/>
          ```out_rows = math.floor(rows / float(downscale))```<br/>
          ```out_cols = math.floor(cols / float(downscale))```

3. Download VGG16 weights from [Here](https://github.com/fchollet/deep-learning-models/releases/download/v0.1/vgg16_weights_tf_dim_ordering_tf_kernels_notop.h5) and put it in ```FgSegNet/FgSegNet/``` dir, or it will be downloaded and stored in ```/.keras/models/``` automatically.

4. Download [CDnet2014 dataset](http://changedetection.net), then put it in the following directory structure:<br/>

    Example:

    ```
      FgSegNet/
           FgSegNet/FgSegNet_M_S_CDnet.py
                   /FgSegNet_M_S_SBI.py
                   /FgSegNet_M_S_UCSD.py
                   /FgSegNet_M_S_module.py
           SBI2015_dataset/
           SBI2015_train/
           UCSD_dataset/
           UCSD_train20/
           UCSD_train50/
           FgSegNet_dataset2014/
                     baseline/

                          skating200
                          ...
                     ...
            CDnet2014_dataset/
                      baseline/
                           highway
                           pedestrians
                           ...
                      badWeather/
                           skating
                           ...
                      ...
    ```

5. There are two methods; i.e. ```FgSegNet_M``` and ```FgSegNet_S```. Choose a method that you want to train by setting ```method_name=='FgSegNet_M' or method_name=='FgSegNet_S'```.

6. Run the codes with **Spyder IDE**. Note that all trained models will be automatically saved (in current working directory) for you.

## Evaluation
### on CDnet2014 dataset

We perform two separated evaluations and report our results on two test splits (```test dev``` & ```test challenge```): <br />
1. We compute our results locally. (on ```test dev``` dataset)
2. We upload our results to [Change Detection 2014 Challenge](http://changedetection.net). (on ```test challenge``` dataset where ground truth values are not shared with the public dataset)<br />
(Both results are reported in our paper. Please refer to it for details)<br />

Compute metrics locally using [CDnet Utilities](http://wordpress-jodoin.dmi.usherb.ca/code/)
#### Note:
- ```test dev```: by considering only the range of the frames that contain the ground truth labels by excluding training frames (50 or 200 frames)
- ```test challenge```: dataset on the server side (http://changedetection.net)
### on SBI2015 dataset

We split 20% for training (denoted by n frames, where n ∈ [2−148]) and 80% for testing.

### on UCSD Background Subtraction dataset

We perform two sets of experiment: first, we split the frames 20% for training (denoted by n frames, where n ∈ [3 − 23]) and 80% for testing, second we split 50% for training (where n ∈ [7 − 56]) and remaining 50% for testing.
